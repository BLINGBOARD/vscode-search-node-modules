# Search node_modules

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonnutter/vscode-search-node-modules/master/img/demo.gif)

Simple plugin for VS Code that allows you to quickly navigate the file inside your project's `node_modules` directory.

Chances are you have the `node_modules` folder excluded from the built-in search in VS Code, which means if you want to open and/or edit a file inside `node_modules`, you can have to find it manually, which can be annoying when your `node_modules` folder is large.

## Features

* Quickly navigate and open files in `node_modules` by traversing the folder tree.
